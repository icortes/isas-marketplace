# Isa's Marketplace

The purpose of this project is to provide a platform for customers to browse and purchase bicycle parts online. The website is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate. The homepage features text and images moving responsively depending on the window size. The products page displays a list of bicycle parts with images, names, and prices, and includes an add to cart button for each bicycle part. The checkout page includes a shopping cart section with a list of bicycle parts and their prices, and a form for users to enter their shipping and payment information. This project is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript.
